# rafo-lib
A Jenkins shared library built around the matrix manager plug-in. 
The matrix manager plug-in allows the security configuration of all pipelines, projects and files through the use of different user and admin roles. 
This library allows for the automation of these security configurations to be automated using a JENKINSFILE.

I do apologize for the insane amount of commits on this repository, do to the nature of my testing setup all changes had to be commited and pushed to allow for testing.
